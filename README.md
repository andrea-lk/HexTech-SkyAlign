# HexTech TurnTable
###  Description: 

The turntable serves as a tracking system for drones. It features a modern aesthetic, utilizing a single stepper motor and a microswitch to smoothly rotate the table and provide antenna tracking. The turntable is designed to dynamically adjust its orientation based on the position of a drone. This system leverages GPS coordinates to follow the drone's movement, allowing for optimal communication with the drone. A graphical user interface guides users to set a zero/north reference point by entering the turntable's coordinates. Users can then input the drone's GPS coordinates to enable automatic tracking.

### Possible Challenges:
- GPS acuracy and delay: Minimizing the delay between receiving GPS coordinates and adjusting the turntable to ensure real-time tracking
- Compatability with various antennas
