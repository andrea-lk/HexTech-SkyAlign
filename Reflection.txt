Developing the turntable, I learned about MQTT communication, position tracking, GUI creation, 
CAD with Autodesk Fusion, and the functioning of motors and gears.

I learned how to use the paho.mqtt.client library for managing MQTT operations,
such as connecting to the broker and publishing messages. Additionally, I learned about
bearing calculations, understanding their mechanics, and converting these calculations into
stepper motor movements. In regard to position tracking, I learned to store and update the
current position after each movement so that there would not be a need to reset to the home
position after every use.

The HexTech board was a key component of this project. The HexTech board was subscribed to an
MQTT server in the cloud. This configuration allowed the software to publish messages to the 
server, which the HexTech board received and executed. Hextech was helpful because it provided 
commands that would communicate with the board's firmware without having to write the C code 
ourselves. Instead of using the  I could just use simple commands to control each pin on the board.
